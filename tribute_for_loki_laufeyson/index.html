          <h2>GOD OF MISCHIEF</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Loki Laufeyson</b> is a god in Norse mythology. According to some
            sources, Loki is the son of Fárbauti (a jötunn) and Laufey
            (mentioned as a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr.
            Loki is married to Sigyn and they have two sons, Narfi or Nari and
            Váli. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf
            Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. In the form of a mare,
            Loki was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and gave birth to
            the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Loki's relation with the gods
            varies by source; he sometimes assists the gods and sometimes
            behaves maliciously towards them. Loki is a shape shifter and in
            separate incidents appears in the form of a salmon, a mare, a fly,
            and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks').
            Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in
            engineering the death of the god Baldr, and eventually, Odin's
            specially engendered son Váli binds Loki with the entrails of one of
            his sons; in the Prose Edda, this son, Nari or Narfi, is killed by
            another son of Loki who is also called Váli. In both the Prose Edda
            and the Poetic Edda, the goddess Skaði is responsible for placing a
            serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from
            above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty
            the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime
            causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the
            onset of Ragnarök, Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and
            to fight against the gods among the forces of the jötnar, at which
            time he will encounter the god Heimdallr, and the two will slay each
            other.
